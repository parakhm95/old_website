							<p>The inspiration of this work is sourced from the biological world where individuals act as a collective to solve problems that are beyond the capabilities of individuals themselves. Such behaviour in the biological species can be seen in the acts of defense, food-hunting, transporting, building, survival, exploration etc. Ants work together to gather food, defend themselves, transport food and build their colonies. Herds of animals do the same for themselves and solve problems of hunting and survival together.</p>
							<p>The recent work in the field of robotics has focused on this problem in various ways. Some of the work focuses on building structures in a collaborative fashion using multiple robots transporting the building blocks for the structure. There has been a great deal of work to explore the control techniques and algorithms for such a collaborative effort. These structures can be put together in little to no-time because of the high number of agents in the robot swarm. Another approach in the field is to use individual robots as the building blocks of the structure. There has been work done in the past to enable efficient assembly process using variety of algorithms. There has also been a good amount of work to show how a structure made-up of these modular robots can lift more weight than the individual components and how the structures can be scaled to perform better and better. Collaborative transporting has been demonstrated where multiple robots lift a payload using grippers or tethers. These collaborative approaches highlight the ability of the system to be of real use in the everyday problems.</p>
							<p> This work itself furthers the work done in [8] where multiple agile quadrotor modules come together to form a structure mid-air. The quadrotor modules have frames fixed to themselves and as such, the structure is a 2-dimensional structure so to say. This work furthers the concept by exploring frames that have 2 DOFs about the quadrotor itself. This enables the stucture to change the shape and orientation post-assembly and behave in a much more complex way. In this manner, the structure can act as more than sum of its parts because of the orientations and shapes that it can achieve. Such a structure provides flexibility and the ability to adapt according to the space constraints imposed.</p>
							<p>As such, this work presents the design and control of a modular structure using this new kind of modules. The modules should be capable of docking and undocking with their neighbours in the air to constitute the structure on their own. The work also aims to present the proper control of such quadrotor modules with swinging frames so as to ensure a stable flying structure once the modules dock together.</p>
