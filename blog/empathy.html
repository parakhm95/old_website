                            <p>Empathy travels through the earth among people everyday. When you are kind and empathetic to someone, they go ahead and spread it by being kind and empathetic to someone else. But is empathy fusion or fission? Does it, like fission, grow exponentially into an uncontrolled chain reaction? Or does it, like fusion, needs to be carefully controlled and sustained? I do not mean to compare fusion and fission in any way to empathy except the uncontrolled explosive chain reaction.</p>
                            <p>
I, personally, think if someone is kind and empathetic to you, you feel like being kind and empathetic to more and more people. But seeing how the world is, these people who you were kind to, do not always lead this on. People take things and forget that they did. Empathy is lost on some people. But I do not blame them. The hardships from everyday life do not leave people with a belief in empathy. I hope it penetrates these people soon.
